2 C programs to simulate movie hacker typing.

hacktype.c: Reads input from a file, then for every keyboard keypress, outputs 1 to 4 characters of the file. Run the program, slam the keyboard, impress onlookers with how fast and correctly you type an entire program.

hacks.c: Reads a string from the commandline, jumbles all the letters, and one by one reveals the correct letters. Inspired by the WarGames scene where the computer can apparently guess one letter at a time of a password like it was a game of Mastermind.
